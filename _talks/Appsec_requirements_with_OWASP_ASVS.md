OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) is a framework for security requirements and verification of these. Compared to OWASP Top 10, ASVS offers a more proactive approach to application security, with differentiated requirements based on the chosen risk profile.

The talk shows how ASVS can be useful as both a template for security requirements in internal software development, as well as for testing applications which are developed by others.
