Process Monitor (procmon) is a powerful tool for observing the behavior of Windows systems. With little configuration, procmon can be used to find bugs that allow privilege escalation as long as you know what to look for and where. This talk will demonstrate the process that Vetle has used to find zero-day vulnerabilities with procmon.
