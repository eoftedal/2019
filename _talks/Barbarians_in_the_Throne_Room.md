Defenders often worry about the intangible security problems. Defenders can best protect the enterprise by focusing on the fundamentals. Too often issues such as patching or system configuration failures lead to system compromise. These along with issues such as SQL injection are preventable problems. Defenders can best protect their digital assets by first understanding the sheer magnitude of the impact a data breach can have on an enterprise.
